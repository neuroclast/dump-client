    <h5>About this Site</h5>
    <p>While this site is designed to be fully functional, its primary goal is as a technology demonstrator and for learning and advancing various frameworks.</p>
    <p>This site is built on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> using <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 5</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>, <a href="http://prismjs.com//">Prism</a>, and various other supporting modules and libraries.</p>
    <p>As the primary goal of this site is neither UI or workflow design, various parts of those elements have been made to mimic highly functional sites, primarily pastebin.net.</p>
